1. NumPy Stands For Numerical Python.
2. It Provides A Good Ability To Create Multidimentional Array Object To Faster Computing.
3. Written For Sciectific Computing.

Numpy Object :  ND Array, This Need To Be Homogenous Arry Means They Have Same Type.
                eg:  [1,2,3] Value Will Be Same
                We Can Take Only Fload and Integer Data Type in numPy Array    
                T
                
                
 NOTE:      Why We Use NumPy Array when We Have A list ?
 Reason :   Because NumPy contain The Paralleliszm Machnism Means,Lets Take A Example
             
             A = [1,2,3,4,5,6,8]
Here We Have 'A' , What Happen When We Have To Sumup A's Element.
When We Use LIST =  It Will Sum Sequentionally mean (1+2,3+3,6+4 ..)So On So Forth
When We Use NumPy Array  = it Will Add Par-lly Means (1+2,6+8,...)So On So Forth
             
             
             
If You Want To Want To Use Numpy Packages SO You Have To Import that

 Syntax :       import numpy as np

Explanation : We Importing Numpy Package And We Can Create A Alias Of That Can Say "np",

               Suppose We Have To use "Shape" Function from NumPy Lib.
               
               np.shape()
